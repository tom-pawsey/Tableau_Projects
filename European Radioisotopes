Radioisotopes across Europe

This dashboard shows where three radioactive isotopes where detected throughout Europe, in the month following the disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Powerstation.
As a Nuclear Physics graduate, this is a subject that I have always found interesting, and so this dashboard was made for no reason other than personal curiosity.
The data used for this dashboard can be found on the kaggle link on the dashboard.
